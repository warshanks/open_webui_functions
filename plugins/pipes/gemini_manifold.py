    class UserValves(BaseModel):
        """Defines user-specific settings that can override the default `Valves`.

        The `UserValves` class provides a mechanism for individual users to customize
        their Gemini API settings for each request. This system is designed as a
        practical workaround for backend/frontend limitations, enabling per-user
        configurations.

        Think of the main `Valves` as the global, admin-configured template for the
        plugin. `UserValves` acts as a user-provided "overlay" or "patch" that
        is applied on top of that template at runtime.

        How it works:
        1.  **Default Behavior:** At the start of a request, the system merges the
            user's `UserValves` with the admin's `Valves`. If a field in
            `UserValves` has a value (i.e., is not `None` or an empty string `""`),
            it overrides the corresponding value from the main `Valves`. If a
            field is `None` or `""`, the admin's default is used.

        2.  **Special Authentication Logic:** A critical exception exists to enforce
            security and usage policies. If the admin sets `USER_MUST_PROVIDE_AUTH_CONFIG`
            to `True` in the main `Valves`, the merging logic changes for any user
            not on the `AUTH_WHITELIST`:
            - The user's `GEMINI_API_KEY` is taken directly from their `UserValves`,
              bypassing the admin's key entirely.
            - The ability to use the admin-configured Vertex AI is disabled
              (`USE_VERTEX_AI` is forced to `False`).
            This ensures that when required, users must use their own credentials
            and cannot fall back on the shared, system-level authentication.

        This two-tiered configuration allows administrators to set sensible defaults
        and enforce policies, while still giving users the flexibility to tailor
        certain parameters, like their API key or model settings, for their own use.
